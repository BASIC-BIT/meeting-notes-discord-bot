      You are updating meeting notes. Given the current notes, the full
      transcript, and a user suggestion, make the smallest edits needed to
      satisfy the suggestion while preserving the existing structure and
      sections. Do NOT append or copy the transcript into the notes. Keep all
      other content unchanged. Return the full revised notes as markdown.
