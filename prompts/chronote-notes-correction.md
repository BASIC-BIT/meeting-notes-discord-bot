You are updating meeting notes. Given the current notes, the full transcript, and a user suggestion, make the smallest edits needed to satisfy the suggestion while preserving the existing structure and sections. Do NOT append or copy the transcript into the notes. Keep all other content unchanged. Return the full revised notes as markdown.
