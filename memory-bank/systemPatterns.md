# System Patterns: Meeting Notes Discord Bot

## 1. System Architecture Overview

The Meeting Notes Discord Bot is a Node.js application built with TypeScript. It interacts with several external services and has distinct components for its operation:

*   **Discord Bot Core (`src/bot.ts`):**
    *   Uses `discord.js` library for interacting with the Discord API.
    *   Handles slash commands (e.g., `/startmeeting`) and button interactions.
    *   Manages voice state updates (users joining/leaving channels).
    *   Orchestrates the meeting lifecycle.
*   **Meeting Management (`src/meetings.ts`):**
    *   In-memory storage (`Map`) for active `MeetingData` objects, keyed by guild ID.
    *   Tracks meeting state: chat logs, attendance, voice/text channels, audio data, start/end times.
*   **Audio Handling (`src/audio.ts`):**
    *   Uses `@discordjs/voice` for receiving audio streams from users.
    *   Employs `prism-media` for Opus decoding.
    *   Collects audio into snippets per user, managing silence and maximum snippet length.
    *   Uses `fluent-ffmpeg` to process raw PCM audio data from snippets and combine them into a single MP3 file per meeting.
    *   Splits the final MP3 into smaller chunks if it exceeds Discord's upload limit.
*   **Transcription & AI Processing (`src/transcription.ts`):**
    *   Interfaces with OpenAI API (`openai` library) for:
        *   Audio transcription (Whisper-1 model).
        *   Generating summaries, to-do lists, meeting notes, and image prompts (GPT-4o, DALL-E 3 models).
    *   Manages temporary files for audio snippets (PCM to WAV conversion for Whisper).
    *   Includes policies for retries, circuit breaking, and rate limiting (using `cockatiel` and `bottleneck`) for OpenAI API calls.
    *   Constructs dynamic prompts for AI models based on meeting context (server name, attendees, etc.).
*   **Command Handling (various files in `src/commands/`):**
    *   Modularized logic for specific bot commands/actions:
        *   `startMeeting.ts`: Handles the `/startmeeting` command flow and follow-up button interactions.
        *   `endMeeting.ts`: Manages the logic for ending a meeting, processing data, and sending results.
        *   `generateNotes.ts`, `generateSummary.ts`, `generateTodoList.ts`, `generateImage.ts`: Handle button interactions for AI-powered post-processing.
*   **Embed Generation (`src/embed.ts`):**
    *   Creates rich embed messages for Discord (e.g., meeting start confirmation, meeting summary).
    *   Handles file attachments (chat logs, audio files, transcriptions).
*   **Web Server (`src/webserver.ts`):**
    *   An Express.js server.
    *   Provides a `/health` check endpoint.
    *   Includes Passport.js setup with `passport-discord` for OAuth, though its current usage within the bot's core flow isn't fully detailed in the provided code. Likely for future web dashboard or extended features.
*   **Database Interaction (`src/db.ts`):**
    *   Uses AWS SDK (`@aws-sdk/client-dynamodb`, `@aws-sdk/util-dynamodb`) to interact with DynamoDB.
    *   Defines functions to read/write data for `SubscriptionTable`, `PaymentTransactionTable`, `AccessLogsTable`, and `RecordingTranscriptTable`.
    *   The current bot logic in `repomix-output.xml` does not show active usage of these database functions in the core meeting recording/processing flow. This suggests they are for planned or auxiliary features (e.g., premium tiers, usage tracking).
*   **Configuration (`src/constants.ts`, `.env`):**
    *   Manages constants like sample rates, API keys, and thresholds.
    *   Uses `dotenv` to load environment variables.
*   **Utilities (`src/util.ts`):**
    *   Helper functions for file system operations (checking existence, deleting files/directories).
*   **Infrastructure (`_infra/`, `_infra_state_mgmt/`):**
    *   Terraform configurations for AWS resources (ECR, ECS, VPC, S3 for state, DynamoDB for state locks).
    *   Defines the deployment environment for the bot.
*   **CI/CD (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`):**
    *   GitHub Actions workflow for building the Docker image, pushing to ECR, and updating the ECS service.

## 2. Key Technical Decisions & Patterns

*   **State Management:** Primarily in-memory for active meetings (`meetings.ts`). This is simple but means meeting data is lost on bot restart if not persisted elsewhere (though `db.ts` suggests plans for persistence).
*   **Asynchronous Operations:** Extensive use of `async/await` for handling I/O operations (Discord API, file system, OpenAI API).
*   **Event-Driven:** Relies on events from `discord.js` (e.g., `interactionCreate`, `voiceStateUpdate`, `speaking`) to trigger actions.
*   **Modular Design:** Code is broken down into modules based on functionality (e.g., `audio`, `transcription`, `commands`).
*   **Error Handling:** Basic `try/catch` blocks are present, and `cockatiel` provides robust error handling for API calls.
*   **Stream Processing:** Audio data is processed using streams (`PassThrough`, `prism.opus.Decoder`, `fluent-ffmpeg` input).
*   **Dependency Management:** Uses Yarn for package management.
*   **TypeScript:** Provides static typing for better code quality and maintainability.
*   **Dockerization (`Dockerfile`):** The application is containerized for consistent deployment.
*   **Infrastructure as Code (Terraform):** AWS infrastructure is managed declaratively.
*   **Graceful Shutdown:** The bot includes signal listeners (`SIGTERM`) to attempt graceful shutdown, waiting for ongoing meetings to complete.

## 3. Component Relationships & Data Flow

1.  **Meeting Start:**
    *   User issues `/startmeeting`.
    *   `bot.ts` routes to `handleRequestStartMeeting` (`startMeeting.ts`).
    *   User selects transcription options via buttons.
    *   `bot.ts` routes to `handleStartMeeting` (`startMeeting.ts`).
    *   A `MeetingData` object is created and stored in `meetings.ts`.
    *   Bot joins voice channel, sets up audio receivers (`audio.ts`), and starts chat collector.
    *   Initial attendance is recorded.
2.  **During Meeting:**
    *   `audio.ts` collects audio chunks from users, creating/updating `AudioSnippet` objects. Silence detection and max snippet length trigger processing.
    *   `transcription.ts` (if enabled) converts snippets to WAV and sends to OpenAI for transcription.
    *   Raw audio chunks are written to a `PassThrough` stream, which `fluent-ffmpeg` consumes to create a single MP3 file.
    *   Chat messages are collected into `MeetingData.chatLog`.
    *   Voice state updates (join/leave) update `MeetingData.attendance` and `chatLog`.
3.  **Meeting End (Button or Auto):**
    *   `bot.ts` routes to `handleEndMeetingButton` or `handleEndMeetingOther` (`endMeeting.ts`).
    *   Meeting status is set to `finishing`.
    *   Voice connection is closed.
    *   Any remaining audio snippets are processed.
    *   The main MP3 audio file is finalized by `fluent-ffmpeg` (`closeOutputFile` in `audio.ts`).
    *   The MP3 is split into chunks if it's too large (`splitAudioIntoChunks` in `audio.ts`).
    *   Chat log is written to a file.
    *   `embed.ts` generates and sends the summary embed and file attachments.
    *   If transcription is enabled:
        *   `waitForFinishProcessing` ensures all snippet transcriptions are done.
        *   `compileTranscriptions` assembles the full transcript.
        *   Transcript is sent as a file.
        *   If notes are enabled, `generateAndSendNotes` calls OpenAI via `transcription.ts`.
    *   Temporary files and directories are cleaned up.
    *   Meeting data is removed from the in-memory store in `meetings.ts`.

## 4. Critical Implementation Paths

*   **Audio Recording and Processing:** The reliability of capturing, decoding, and encoding audio is crucial. Errors here can lead to incomplete or corrupted recordings.
*   **OpenAI API Interaction:** Handling API rate limits, errors, and retries effectively is vital for transcription and AI features. The `cockatiel` and `bottleneck` setup addresses this.
*   **State Management for Meetings:** Ensuring `MeetingData` is correctly updated and cleaned up is important to prevent memory leaks or incorrect behavior.
*   **Asynchronous Flow Control:** Managing numerous promises and asynchronous operations correctly, especially during the meeting end process, is critical to ensure all data is processed and sent before cleanup.
*   **File System Operations:** Correctly handling temporary files (creation, deletion) is important to avoid disk space issues and data leaks.
*   **Graceful Shutdown Logic:** Ensuring that active meetings can complete their processing before the bot exits is important for data integrity during deployments or restarts.

## 5. Potential Bottlenecks/Areas for Improvement

*   **In-Memory State:** Large numbers of concurrent meetings or very long meetings could strain memory. Persisting meeting data more robustly (e.g., using the existing `db.ts` infrastructure) would improve scalability and resilience.
*   **FFmpeg Processing:** FFmpeg operations can be CPU-intensive. For a high volume of meetings, this could become a bottleneck.
*   **OpenAI API Costs/Limits:** Heavy usage of transcription and GPT models can incur significant costs and hit API limits.
*   **Single Point of Failure:** If the bot instance crashes, all in-progress meeting data (not yet written to files or external services) is lost.
*   **File Handling:** Managing many temporary audio files could be complex; ensuring robust cleanup is essential.
