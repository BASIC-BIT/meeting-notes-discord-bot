# Active Context: Meeting Notes Discord Bot - GPT-4o Audio Migration Complete

## 1. Current Work Focus

The primary focus was the **migration from Whisper-1 to GPT-4o-transcribe model** for audio transcription. This migration has been **successfully completed**.

**Migration Summary:**

- Updated `src/transcription.ts` to use `"gpt-4o-transcribe"` instead of `"whisper-1"`
- Maintained all existing functionality and API parameters
- No breaking changes introduced
- Cost should remain equivalent according to user confirmation

## 2. Recent Changes

- **GPT-4o Audio Migration Completed:**
  - `src/transcription.ts`: Changed model from `"whisper-1"` to `"gpt-4o-transcribe"`
  - All existing parameters maintained (verbose_json, language, prompt, temperature)
  - Response processing logic unchanged (filtering still applies)
  - Rate limiting and resilience patterns unchanged
- **Process Documentation:**
  - Created `implementation-plan-gpt4-audio-migration.md` (temporary file)
  - Created `meta-implementation-process.md` (permanent process documentation)

## 3. Next Steps (Immediate)

1.  **Memory Bank Update:** Update progress.md and other relevant memory bank files to reflect the migration
2.  **Implementation Plan Cleanup:** Delete the temporary implementation plan file
3.  **Testing Validation:** The migration should be tested in a real environment to ensure GPT-4o-transcribe works as expected
4.  **Future Enhancement Consideration:** The enhanced context capabilities of GPT-4o-transcribe can be evaluated in future iterations

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

- **Full Migration Approach:** Chose complete migration over gradual rollout based on user preference and equivalent cost
- **API Compatibility:** GPT-4o-transcribe uses the same API endpoint and parameters as Whisper-1
- **Response Format:** Maintained `verbose_json` format to preserve existing filtering logic
- **Enhanced Context:** GPT-4o-transcribe supports richer context prompting, but this is deferred for future evaluation

## 5. Important Patterns & Preferences (Observed from Codebase)

- **TypeScript & Modularity:** The codebase heavily relies on TypeScript for type safety and is structured into functional modules (e.g., `audio.ts`, `bot.ts`, `commands/`, `transcription.ts`).
- **Asynchronous Operations:** `async/await` is standard for handling I/O and API calls.
- **Configuration Management:** Centralized constants and environment variable loading (`constants.ts`, `.env.example`).
- **Clear Separation of Concerns:** Different aspects like bot logic, audio processing, API interaction, and command handling are in separate files/modules.
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Terraform is used for managing AWS resources, indicating a preference for declarative infrastructure.
- **CI/CD Automation:** GitHub Actions are used for automated deployment, showing a commitment to streamlined deployment processes.
- **Error Handling & Resilience:** Use of `cockatiel` and `bottleneck` for OpenAI API calls demonstrates an awareness of the need for robust external service interaction.

## 6. Learnings & Project Insights

- **AI Model Migration:** The migration from Whisper-1 to GPT-4o-transcribe was straightforward due to API compatibility
- **Process Documentation:** The meta-implementation-process.md provides a reusable framework for future AI agentic coding tasks
- **Memory Bank Effectiveness:** The memory bank system successfully facilitated context preservation across the migration task
- **Enhanced Capabilities:** GPT-4o-transcribe offers potential for improved transcription accuracy and enhanced context understanding
- **Future Opportunities:** The new model's enhanced context capabilities could enable better speaker identification and meeting structure understanding
