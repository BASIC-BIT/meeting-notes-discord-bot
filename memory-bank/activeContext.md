# Active Context: Meeting Notes Discord Bot - Initialization

## 1. Current Work Focus

The primary focus is the **initialization of the Memory Bank** for the Meeting Notes Discord Bot. This involves creating the foundational documentation set (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) based on a comprehensive analysis of the existing codebase provided in `repomix-output.xml`.

The goal is to establish a baseline understanding of the project's purpose, architecture, technology stack, and current state to facilitate future development and maintenance, especially given Cline's memory reset characteristic.

## 2. Recent Changes

*   **Memory Bank Creation:** The core memory bank files are being created for the first time.
    *   `projectbrief.md`: Defines project purpose, requirements, goals, and scope.
    *   `productContext.md`: Outlines the problem solved, user experience, and product goals.
    *   `systemPatterns.md`: Details the system architecture, technical decisions, and data flows.
    *   `techContext.md`: Lists technologies, development setup, constraints, and tool usage.
    *   This file, `activeContext.md`, is being written.
    *   `progress.md` will be created next.

## 3. Next Steps (Immediate)

1.  **Create `progress.md`:** Document what currently works, what's left to build (based on initial analysis), current status, known issues (if any can be inferred), and the evolution of project decisions (initially, this will reflect the state as understood from `repomix-output.xml`).
2.  **Review and Refine:** Once all core memory bank files are created, a self-review might be beneficial to ensure consistency and completeness based on the initial `repomix-output.xml`.
3.  **Await Further Instructions:** After memory bank initialization, the next steps will be dictated by new tasks or user requests.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

*   **Information Source:** All information for the initial memory bank is derived from the `repomix-output.xml` file, which contains a snapshot of the entire repository.
*   **File Granularity:** The memory bank files are designed to cover specific aspects of the project to ensure focused and organized documentation.
*   **Assumptions:** Some interpretations are made based on common practices and the structure of the provided code (e.g., purpose of `db.ts` or the frontend). These should be verified if future tasks require deeper dives into those areas.
*   **Living Documentation:** The Memory Bank is intended to be a living set of documents, updated continuously as the project evolves.

## 5. Important Patterns & Preferences (Observed from Codebase)

*   **TypeScript & Modularity:** The codebase heavily relies on TypeScript for type safety and is structured into functional modules (e.g., `audio.ts`, `bot.ts`, `commands/`, `transcription.ts`).
*   **Asynchronous Operations:** `async/await` is standard for handling I/O and API calls.
*   **Configuration Management:** Centralized constants and environment variable loading (`constants.ts`, `.env.example`).
*   **Clear Separation of Concerns:** Different aspects like bot logic, audio processing, API interaction, and command handling are in separate files/modules.
*   **Infrastructure as Code:** Terraform is used for managing AWS resources, indicating a preference for declarative infrastructure.
*   **CI/CD Automation:** GitHub Actions are used for automated deployment, showing a commitment to streamlined deployment processes.
*   **Error Handling & Resilience:** Use of `cockatiel` and `bottleneck` for OpenAI API calls demonstrates an awareness of the need for robust external service interaction.

## 6. Learnings & Project Insights (Initial Pass)

*   The project is a functional Discord bot with core features for recording meetings, processing audio, and interacting with OpenAI for value-added services like transcription and summarization.
*   It has a well-defined deployment pipeline using Docker, ECR, ECS, and Terraform.
*   There's an auxiliary web server component, likely for OAuth or future web-based interactions, though not central to the current bot functionality.
*   Database interaction (`db.ts`) is defined but doesn't appear to be actively used in the primary meeting recording/processing flow, suggesting it's for planned features (e.g., subscriptions, detailed logging).
*   The frontend (`src/frontend`) is a standard Create React App, likely for similar auxiliary purposes as the web server.
*   The bot handles graceful shutdowns to complete ongoing meeting processing.
