## 2025-12-04 work log

- Structured identities: added `Participant {id, tag, nickname?, globalName?}` and a per-meeting participants map; MeetingHistory now stores `participants` (legacy attendees tolerated for old items).
- Structured chat: chatLog now stores `ChatEntry` objects (message/join/leave) with user IDs and name snapshots; added rendering helper; prompts and chat files use structured data.
- Transcript JSON: groundwork to emit segments with user identity; S3 upload service will write transcript txt/json.
- S3 artifacts: added upload service to save combined audio, chat txt/json, transcript txt/json per meeting folder; MeetingHistory records `audioS3Key`, `chatS3Key`, `transcriptS3Key`.
- End-of-meeting flow uploads artifacts after transcript generation; sends Discord files, then persists to S3 before cleanup.
- New helpers: generic S3 upload, participant snapshot builder, chat rendering helper.
- MinIO convenience: `docker:minio-init` script added earlier; compose updated to latest minio images.
- Type refactors: MeetingData updated for structured chat/participants; storage helper refactored to reuse generic upload.
- Outstanding: full test/lint not yet rerun after these changes; ensure env bucket exists for uploads.
