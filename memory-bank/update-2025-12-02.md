## 2025-12-02 work log

- Prompting: meeting notes system prompt now nudges concise output, warns about 5s batching speaker order, includes bot identity, and surfaces recent chat/instructions; pulls trimmed chat log for context.
- Pagination: added embed pagination utility and wired notes posting/editing to split descriptions under 4096 chars with part headers.
- History schema: MeetingHistory now stores suggestionsHistory, notesHistory, transcriptS3Key; notesVersion/edited metadata refined.
- Corrections: correction prompt now sees prior suggestions and full transcript (from S3 if present); conditional notes update prevents races; embeds re-render paginated on edit.
- Transcripts: full transcript uploads to S3 (bucket/prefix envs), Dynamo keeps short excerpt; helper service for put/get.
- Config/docs/env: added storage settings to configService, .env.example, AGENTS.md; dependency @aws-sdk/client-s3 added (lock not regenerated here).
