One thing to note is we have made a couple of small repository changes changes to the repo since you last looked at it. So understand if there's any small differences between the file as it was when you did your original research and now. That that's why and you should just be able to seamlessly understand the differences between the change sets and work through it accordingly, adapting your plan as you need.
