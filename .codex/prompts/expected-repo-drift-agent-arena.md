description: Addendum prompt to inform the agent that I expect codebase and context drift due to overlapping work streams, with a more active warning that another agent is actively working in the same codebase because Codex seems to hate worktrees ;v;

One thing to note is we have made a couple of small repository changes changes to the repo since you last looked at it. So understand if there's any small differences between the file as it was when you did your original research and now. That that's why and you should just be able to seamlessly understand the differences between the change sets and work through it accordingly, adapting your plan as you need.

Be advised that another coding agent is currently also working in the same codebase. They are currently working on another feature within the codebase. So for right now try to just work in your own area of the codebase and if you see changes or failing tests/checks due to things that seem unrelated to your work, that you can safely temporarily work around them while continuing to iterate on your side of the codebase.
