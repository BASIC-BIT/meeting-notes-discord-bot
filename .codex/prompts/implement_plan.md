Alright, your plan is good, go ahead and implement it. Make sure to look for any situations that we can reduce complexity while still maintaining functionality. Feel free to find moments of serendipitous refactoring. By the end make sure that you've implemented the whole functionality including any relevant testing (new or updated), and that our checks pass.
