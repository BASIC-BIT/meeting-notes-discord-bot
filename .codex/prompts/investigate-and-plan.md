description: Investigate and plan a changeset
argument-hint:
---

Investigate this error or idea thoroughly with both internet research and codebase research (including any/all relevant parts of the codebase including infra, frontend, backend, discord bot, package.json, documentation, etc.) and propose a changeset for review. Ask me open questions you have to clarify implementation before writing any code. Provide defaults for each of your questions if possible.

If the issue mentions a PR or Issue, use the github cli to get any information necessary.

Once the plan is agreed upon, you execute; when you're done with your initial implementation (and occasionally throughout if deemed valuable) ensure that our checks pass - tests, build, lint, etc. By the end, ensure all of them pass along with the e2e and complexity stuff such that the PR would go green.
