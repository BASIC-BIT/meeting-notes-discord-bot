## Chat-to-Speech MVP Spec

### Summary

Add a chat-to-speech (TTS) feature that speaks every message typed in the voice-channel text chat during active meetings, plus a /say command for manual speech. The feature is gated to Basic/Pro, supports a server default and channel override, and allows per-user voice selection with per-user opt-out. Spoken chat is queued with Chronote live voice replies so audio never overlaps, and it is included in the meeting recording and transcript.

### Goals

- Speak every message in the voice-channel text chat while a meeting is active.
- Allow /say to speak a single message without enabling auto TTS.
- Speak only for users currently in the voice channel.
- Allow server default + channel override (channel can enable even if server default is off).
- Allow per-user opt-out ("do not speak my messages").
- Allow per-user voice selection (per server).
- Ensure bot audio never overlaps and supports a stop/clear command.
- Include spoken chat in recording and transcript.
- Avoid duplicate chat vs transcript entries in the Library timeline.

### Non-goals (Future improvements)

- Role-based permissions for chat-to-speech and /say.
- Dedicated TTS-only text channel.
- Global user preferences across servers.
- Advanced rate limiting beyond simple caps.
- User-specific "do not hear others" (not feasible in shared voice).
- Multi-voice or multi-language routing.

## Feature behavior

### When TTS triggers

- A meeting is active in a guild and chat-to-speech is enabled (resolved from defaults/overrides).
- Message is in the voice channel's associated text chat (the channel where the meeting was started or configured for auto-record).
- Message author is currently connected to the same voice channel.
- Message author is not a bot.
- Message content is non-empty after trimming.

### Playback behavior

- All bot audio (Chronote live voice replies and chat-to-speech) goes through a single per-meeting queue.
- Audio is serialized; one utterance must finish before the next plays.
- A /tts stop command stops the current playback and clears the queue.

### Recording and transcript

- TTS audio is mixed into the meeting recording (same pipeline as live voice).
- Each spoken chat message adds a transcript segment with:
  - source: "chat_tts"
  - messageId (Discord message id)
- The transcript remains the canonical "what was heard" source.

### Library timeline (de-dupe)

- Chat entries are still stored in chat.json for export and audit.
- Timeline merges transcript segments and chat log:
  - If a transcript segment has source: "chat_tts", render it as a dedicated event type (e.g., tts) and suppress the matching chat entry by messageId to avoid duplicates.

## Settings and precedence

### Server defaults

Stored in ServerContext:

- chatTtsEnabled?: boolean
- chatTtsVoice?: string (server default voice for user TTS)
- liveVoiceTtsVoice?: string (server default voice for Chronote live voice, distinct from user TTS)

### Channel override

Stored in ChannelContext:

- chatTtsEnabled?: boolean (nullable/tri-state, like liveVoiceEnabled)

### Per-user (per-server) settings

New UserSpeechSettings table:

- guildId (pk)
- userId (sk)
- chatTtsDisabled?: boolean
- chatTtsVoice?: string
- updatedAt, updatedBy

### Resolution order (MVP)

- finalChatTtsEnabled = limits.liveVoiceEnabled && (channelOverride ?? serverDefault)
- Per-user does not enable; it only disables:
  - If chatTtsDisabled === true, do not speak that user's messages.
- Voice selection:
  - voice = user.chatTtsVoice ?? server.chatTtsVoice ?? config default
- Chronote live voice uses:
  - server.liveVoiceTtsVoice ?? config default

---

## Data model changes

### ChatEntry

Add:

- messageId?: string
- source?: "chat" | "chat_tts" (default "chat")

### Transcript segment

Extend JSON in S3 with optional fields:

- source?: "voice" | "chat_tts" | "bot"
- messageId?: string

### DynamoDB

Add table: UserSpeechSettings

- Partition key: guildId
- Sort key: userId
- PAY_PER_REQUEST, PITR, KMS app_general (match existing)

---

## Commands and UI

### Discord commands

1. /tts disable - opt out (per server)
2. /tts enable - remove opt-out
3. /tts voice <voice> - set per-user voice (per server)
4. /tts stop - stop current playback and clear queue (requires ManageChannels OR meeting creator)
5. /say message - speak one message aloud (requires active meeting and voice channel presence)

### Frontend Settings (server settings page)

Global defaults:

- Toggle: "Enable chat-to-speech by default"
- Select: "Default chat-to-speech voice"
- Select: "Default Chronote voice"
  Channel override list:
- Toggle per channel: "Chat-to-speech override"

### Library timeline

Add event type tts with a unique icon and label (e.g., "Spoken chat").

---

## Abuse controls (MVP)

- Max characters per spoken message (config default, e.g., 400).
- Max queue depth per meeting (config default, e.g., 10).
- If a message exceeds limit: truncate or skip with a brief warning in text channel.
- /tts stop to kill current playback and clear queue.

---

## Telemetry and logging

- Log when TTS is enqueued, truncated, skipped (opt-out, not in voice, disabled, queue full).
- Add counters: chat_tts_enqueued, chat_tts_spoken, chat_tts_dropped.

---

## Testing plan

1. Unit tests:
   - Resolver precedence (server/channel/user).
   - Queue behavior (serial playback, stop/clear).
   - Chat entry -> transcript segment mapping with messageId.
2. Integration tests:
   - Meeting start respects limits.liveVoiceEnabled gating for chat TTS.
   - Library timeline dedupe for chat_tts.
3. Manual:
   - Start meeting, send messages as voice channel member and non-member.
   - Confirm bot speaks only member messages.
   - Toggle server default and channel override; verify behavior.
   - Set per-user voice and opt-out.
   - Test /tts stop.
