# Visual regression tests

Playwright visual tests capture screenshots for key UI pages and compare them
against baselines to detect unintended UI changes.
The visual suite captures two snapshots for each view. Component-level crops
should live in Storybook instead.
The viewport snapshot shows the exact first-load view at the Playwright
viewport size with no layout overrides. The full snapshot enables visual mode
so headers, footers, and scroll areas expand to show all content.
Visual mode is toggled with query parameters. Use `?visual=1` (or `?screenshot=1`)
to enable it and `?visual=0` to disable it.

## Running locally

- Update baselines: `yarn test:visual:update`
- Compare against current baselines: `yarn test:visual`

The visual tests run in mock mode, use fixed mock timestamps, and disable
animations for stable snapshots.

## Handling nondeterministic UI

- Prefer deterministic mock data first. Keep timestamps, random IDs, and seeded
  lists derived from the fixed mock time instead of `Date.now()`.
- If time needs to be frozen in the browser, use Playwright Clock
  (`page.clock.setFixedTime(...)`) for the test or test suite.
- If a small region is intentionally dynamic, mask it with `toHaveScreenshot`
  options (`mask`, `maskColor`, or `stylePath`) rather than loosening the whole
  diff.
- If you must allow small pixel drift, use `maxDiffPixels`,
  `maxDiffPixelRatio`, or `threshold` on that specific screenshot assertion.

Note: Snapshots are OS-specific. CI runs on Windows, so baselines use the
win32 suffix. If you update snapshots on macOS or Linux, expect different
filenames and diffs.

## CI behavior

- PRs run the Visual Regression job.
- The job checks out base branch snapshots, runs visual tests on the PR, and
  uploads artifacts:
  - `playwright-report` HTML report
  - `test-results` with expected, actual, and diff images
  - `visual-summary.md` with the change list
- A PR comment is posted with the summary and a link to the Actions run.

## Adding new views

- Add a new `@visual` test in `test/e2e/visual.spec.ts`.
- Run `yarn test:visual:update`.
- Commit the new snapshots in `test/e2e/visual.spec.ts-snapshots`.
- Expect two snapshots per view, with `-viewport` and `-full` suffixes.
